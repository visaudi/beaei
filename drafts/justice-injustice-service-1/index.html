        <h1>Justice, Injustice, Service</h1>

        <p>I feel the electric release of a magnificent departure. Justice was watching over us. I never doubted her care or support. I knew she was with us. I knew what her righteous arm upheld. I felt so safe: not a thought of how my freedom depends upon the cooperation of those beyond me. Now ahead may be different. There is no assurance: we can support one another for the good of all or drag each other down by our own 'individualism'.</p>

        <p>For almost four years now, despite this, we have held a heavy burden. Tenth-rate industrial strength brutality skinny dips in the Reflecting Pool as a joke designed for those who pale at the sight of 'other'. For nearly half a year, our footsteps have been circumscribed by invisible flames which have already burnt far too many of our kin. Listen closely: hear the muffled lamentations of mothers cut from their babes through suburban walls that bleach away 'the illegal'. Indigineous buriel grounds again defiled: we deny the sovreignty of people already exploited, assassinated and again discarded. Must others always suffer for our 'supremacy'? When will we finally rise together saying the names of all those lives our ignorance has slain?</p>

        <p>Who do you depend upon? I depend upon my parents, my partner Ann, my cat Charles, my friends, retail workers, baristas, postal workers, ride share workers, my therapist Jack, librarians, nurses, doctors, teachers, the myriad of people around the world who help make all the physical things that fit my life, the farmworkers who defy the sun to pick what I eat and until last night: Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Although unlike many other service workers who risk their lives against an invisible virus, our Justice Ginsburg defied more pains than cancer and old age for our freedom. Though she could have enjoyed a sophisticated retirement delighting in Opera and in the wealth of culture our society still may lavish upon the lucky, Justice Ginsburg was a true service worker. Her eyes were fixed on the support she gave us all, even to the tricky line of death.</p>

        <p>Service workers help all of us make it through at one time or another. Nobody makes it in this world all by their brilliant self. The patient teacher who cares about the student's passions: Xe stays with the student supporting the flame within that will become a star. The postal worker defying orders risks her job bringing online the sorting machines that her promise of "every piece, every day" be sustained. Many of us know someone who beaten with hammers perpetually had some social worker or therapist believe in him and hold his hand till he made it on his own. The grocers, the retail workers, the librarians, the servers, baristas wearing masks all day long, reminding furious, tyranical patrons to wear a covering so that those who share space need not lose sleep over their health. We see webspaces commemorating the nurses and doctors who never came home because they would not hold back or because they kept working despite the lack of support they themselves received. I keep thinking of RBG in the gym pushing up that medicine ball, doing pushups or lifting weights: fighting for more life. She knew the difference her service made.</p>

        <p>When I take a student, I don't care much about the money I make despite my painful student debt. I am a teacher to help others live a life they can actually believe in. I want to help others. I want to support them into living a life that drives them out of bed. That's what I love doing with my life. I am a service worker. We have always existed in some form because humans have always got ahead by helping each other. Even Donald Trump knows that, in some sense, when he demands loyalty or he "takes care" of his base. Donald Trump is the basest form of service worker. He knows how to throw a great party, but you'll pay for it dearly, one way or another. If not now, just wait. In the short run, the Donald Trumps can show their measured effect. In the long run, we are all poorer for it. Who among his supporters has gone back through all his frauds to trace the long term impact of his actions? Our individualism will never save us or make us happy in the long run, but our passion for each other is enough to change the whole world beyond our wildest imaginings into a place that is really good for all. Do we ask for so much more than that?</p>
         
        <p>We see today so many fellow humans who made no boundary where they have given, out on the street. The whole motion of their purposes are ruining down to disintigration. Their lives rot with too few jobs for meaningful action. The rich profit disgustingly. Was the hard striving of workers in vain? Was it their fault the economy cracked apart? Should we treat our workers as if they are disposable? Workers are not alone. We are a comprehensively broken nation. We used to believe that everyone ought to get a fair chance to succeed at life. What does that mean today? When did we stop caring? Did we ever really care enough? Where is our decency? How did we get to be so unsupportive of each other? The audacious grace of our Justice Ginsburg reminds me how much one institutional colossus unites, even defying extreme pain. She sacrificed her joy to make all our lives better.</p>

        <p>Yet, let's not make Ruth or anyone 'special'. We have within intermixed power to be saints and sinners. Ginsburg once remarked about Colin Kaepernick's kneeling rather than saluting the flag: "I think it's dumb and disrespectful." How could so sensitive a Justice be so far off? Though she apologized, many people who do great good in the west are also capable of great harm. I don't believe the United States ever truly destroyed the Confederacy. The 'serpent' that Julia Ward Howe was fighting against in the Battle Hymn of the Republic was in Europe far before we arrived at America's shores. It was already virulent in the Union and Confederacy. We caught glimpses of it. Montaigne grasped it when he celebrated the honest virtue of indigineous people's against the treacherous duplicity of Europe. Even with this, the West could not fully repudiate the evil that had grown within us. How could such an analytical, reductionist culture which views selves as separate individuals come to the understanding that burns among more now? We were conceived in this sin when we exalted "eye for an eye" punishment. Authoratarianism, hierarchy, destructive revenge, empire all grew up together. They have conditioned western thought. We are far from healed. Any of us today can still be an oppressor, but we do have the passcodes for abandoning our mythologies of phony sainthood. We have the power to ascend as we honor the gadfly truth who frees us from myopic shadows which grow as we try to solve our sphinx's pluridimensional rubik's cube.</p>

        <p>If you have been wrong, it's never too late to say the truth. If you have hurt someone, blindly or intentionally, even if they will never forgive you, your awareness of your impact upon them will mean that you have made yourself more trustworthy. When we make mistakes, we are not weak for telling the truth. We are weak as a society because the truth is so hard to get to; everyone's individual power is diminished. Ohno Taiichi the iconoclast manager at the Toyota Motor Company would challenge assumptions of anyone on his work floor. If the lowest worker on the floor showed him he was wrong, he would vocaly admit it. It didn't make the workers think he was weak, it made them take him seriously. Toyota, under his leadership, became the best car company in the world. How can we take each other seriously, if we can't say when we are wrong?</p>

        <p>If you admit the truth, you may lose power. For most in the U.S., this is unbearable. If you admit the truth it means you have to move on. You can't repeat the same mistake as if nothing's changed. You have to give up something that may have benefited you. Is it really a benefit? A child steals cookies from his sister. The parents never know. He may do this over again. He may get away with it. She learns to never trust him. She hides everything from him. She loses all warmth she once had for him, but he got the cookies! Who's the winner here? In truth nobody. He got a short term reward that will lead him to get more short term rewards. Why does Donald Trump care so much about getting credit for everything? If you dispose of someone who cares about you for a benefit, you are still a human. You will want to feel love. You can even make people praise you. No matter the quantity or quality: the praise will never be enough.</p>

        <p>Only the truth is enough. A caring service worker knows this. A charlitan who pretends to serve you may cheat for you to get something that you coudn't have had otherwise. A con man doesn't actually care about you, he's looking to be rewarded. If he can fool you long enough to get what he wants then run away before you figure out, he get's his reward. A caring service worker tells the truth because Xe wants something that is good for everyone in the long run. You can't lie forever. Eventually you get caught. A man dying of cancer went into remission. It was a tremendous joy that his family finally spent time with him. He never bothered to tell them he was in remission. I can only imagine the feelings of betrayal when they did find out. How could that possibly have given anyone what they wanted? He was terrified to lose them. He confirmed the manipulativeness which kept them away in the first place. If you want something that lasts, you need honesty. Everyone wants to be free to make their own decisions. When people make decisions for others by deceit, who would want to be near such manipulators? Honesty is the fabric of cooperation and sustained relationship.</p>

        Though today such fabric is in shreds, we can weave a new world the light we have always held. There is no need to be a Supreme Court Justice. Ask yourself, "what is most urgent today that I care about that effects many of us?" Make a list. You don't have to sit wait, worry and do nothing in cognitive paralysis. Find the people working at what you care about. If there are none around, make a sign and do something. Stand up for Black Lives. Stand up for the Postal Service. Stand up for elections. Register people to vote. Make leaflets that help people take action and pass them out. Campaign against Trump. Stand for for the wishes of Ruth Bader Ginsburg that we let the election determine our next Justice. You can call people. Write a blog post. Make a video. Whenever you can, tell people how you feel on Facebook or Twitter. Listen to someone who disagrees with you. It is urgent right now. We all need to wake up and do something. Do something for your friends, for your family, for the vulnerable, for your neighbors, for your grandchildren, for society, for your country, for the planet, for your ancestors, for your dog or your cat but whatever you do don't be caught waiting.</p>

        <p>Don't be caught surprised when the fascists pound on your door. Experiment. If it doesn't work, try something else. How do you measure success and failure? We don't need to be perfect, but we cannot let up. You can do this. If enough of us are actively working against our ills, just the sheer numbers of our effort suggest our success. Miyamoto Musashi once said: "the fastest sword is the one that's never drawn." "You are not required to complete the work, but neither are you from to desist from it." We need to keep leaning on this. You don't have to be a democrat or like Joe Biden to do that. All you need to do is keep showing up. Keep showing up to protests. Keep showing up to help out, one way or another. We don't need to be violent to accomplish anything, but if we are all trying our best, whatever that is, our strength shall be be on display to the world. Do something you believe in. If you try something and it gets nowhere try something else, but whatever you do keep going. "Never die easy." I believe in you. Trust that we can do this. It's the right thing.</p>
