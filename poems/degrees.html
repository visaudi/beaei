        <h1>degrees</h1>
      
        <p>Walls like rivers ruining through the powdery sky</p>
        <p>I alone, trying to make it to the next paragraph.</p>
        
        <p>
            Do you think they like me?
            <br />
            Of course they don't.
            <br />
            Who the fuck are you?
            <br />
            Even when I try, I don't know where to start!
            <br />
            If only we might hear each other, a little.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I hear its thundering flow: loud wrath.
            <br />
            Wrath forged in a precarious bending arc more like a compass than a circuit.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            How long shall we wait for this slow motion bending of nightmares and dreams?
            <br />
            We can see the promise so distant from the broken prism chambers of our hearts
            <br />
            hearing the trickling blood so far and so close.
            <br />
            Bitwise wonders shall not wipe you tears away.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            If not now what am I?
            <br />
            And if not enough:
            <br />
            nothing?
            <br />
            Those beloved bits inscribed on the smallest parts of our hearts:
            <br />
            may we two just for a short while be together like those tiny moments
            <br />
            when people so far apart
            <br />
            and in so much darkness
            <br />
            uncannily shock us with unconscious love.
