The Haunting of Senator Sinema

Emily and Soren come running

Emily: (playfully) Is this the overqualified Senator Kyrsten Sinema?

Soren: Kyrsten, it's like we never knew you!

KS: Oh, please, it's not like--

Emily: Our phone calls go--

KS: I told you, things would be different.

Emily: To see our comrades having to chase you following you all the way until you could only pit women against those who depend upon you for their way of life! Really? It's not funny when children stay home, they get to say goodbye if they're parents get dragged into where?

KS: I wish someone would drag me off. Are you just going to say mean things to me?

Emily b: What can I do? You don't expect me to pray for you?

KS: Remember that night when the moon was in pieces and our pulses all spoke; when our breath was one--

Soren: You could have asked me to do anything that night. What have you been doing with Margret White? Margret effing White! The director of No Labels. Why is she talking about "your heroic efforts?" Does she mean your protecting the wealthy from "paying their fair share?" Does this mean that medicare will not negotiate down the price of perscription drugs? 94 percent of Arizonans want this. What are you thinking?

KS: What am I thinking? Everybody loves a maverick!

Soren: Sometimes that (with Emily) changes (Emily and Soren look at each other and look at KS).

Emily: Are you still here? We had a â€¦! At this point it seems so silly to point out how we knocked on doors for you taking heavy Arizona laser beam fire. Where is that where now? For real, are you here for us?

KS: Just trust me.

Emily: I don't know whether to laugh or cry! We don't have time to trust you, but I will trust that the person I once believed in is still here. Kyrsten if you can hear me, please come back. If you have taken the money and are trapped, we can buy you out. We will raise money. If you want to come back, maybe we can help you. If not though: if you're stuck in your ways, we will make sure you can't do this to us again. You campaigned on fighting for lower perscription prices, but now your new friends want you to take back your word. Which Side are you on?

Sorin: Hold the line and we will have your back or prepare to be primaried!
