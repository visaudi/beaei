The Haunting of Senator Sinema

Emily and Soren come running in wearing two ghostee costumes for Halloween

Emily: (playfully) Is this the overqualified Senator Kyrsten Sinema?

Soren: Kyrsten, it's like we never knew you!

KS: Please, it's not like--

Emily: All our calls go--

KS: I told you, things would be different.

Emily: I see our comrades driven to chasing you to make you do right, but you pit women against life and death striving immigrants using a tiny bathroom! Really? It's not funny when children stay home, to say goodbye if their parents get dragged away to where?

KS: I wish someone would drag me off. Are you just going to say mean things to me?

Emily: What can I do? You don't expect me to pray for your soul?

KS: Remember that night when the moon was in pieces and our pulses all spoke; when our breath was one--

Soren: You could have asked me to do anything that night. Now I just wonder what you've been doing, with Margret White? Margret effing White! The director of No Labels. Why is she talking about "your heroic efforts?" Does she mean you're protecting the wealthy from "paying their fair share?" Does this mean that Medicare will not negotiate down the price of perscription drugs? 94 percent of Arizonans want this. What are you thinking?

KS: What am I thinking? Everybody loves a maverick!

Soren: Sometimes that (with Emily) changes (Emily and Soren look at each other and look at KS).

Emily: Are you still here Kyrsten? We had …! We took heavy Arizona fire knocking on doors for you. Are you here for us?

KS: Just trust me.

Emily: I don't know whether to laugh or … punch you in the face! We don't have time to trust you, but I will trust that the person I once believed in is still there. Kyrsten if you can hear me, please come back. If you are trapped by your donations: we can buy you back. We will raise money. If you want to come back, let us help you. If not: if this is what you want, we will haunt you. You campaigned on lower perscriptions, your new friends are breaking your word. Will we have nothing at Glasgow to show the whole world how shall save the planet? Which Side are you on?

Sorin: Hold the line and we will have your back, otherwise we'll be haunting you in your primaries!
