As you cross the rubicon,
Though dust to gunpowder,
would you consider we who are fighting for life?
And although we fight with our lives
we love you.
Can you avoid your leaders orders?
We’re not asking you to fight orders directly, immediately.
We invite you to safely fail your objectives where possible.

When a target is in sight:
you may choose to miss!
If I was trapped there with you,
I’d like to believe I’d do what’s due to not kill nor be killed.

Take care!
Good luck!
